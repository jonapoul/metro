# ðŸš‡ Metro

# Introduction

Metro is a compile-time dependency injection framework that draws heavy inspiration from [Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger), [Anvil](https://github.com/square/anvil), and [Kotlin-Inject](https://github.com/evant/kotlin-inject). It seeks to unify their best features under one, cohesive solution while adding a few new features and implemented as a compiler plugin.

### Why another DI framework?

Itâ€™s felt for some time like the Kotlin community has been waiting for a library at the intersection of these different tools and features. Different tools exist for parts of these, but thereâ€™s not yet been a unified solution that checks all these boxes, leaves behind some of these toolsâ€™ limitations, and embraces newer features that native compiler plugins offer.

In short, Metro stands on the shoulders of giants. It doesnâ€™t try to reinvent the wheel, it does try to make those wheels work better together.

!!! note
    _Iâ€™m aware of the [XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/927/) ðŸ™‚, I think Metro offers a compelling feature set with interop hooks that make it easy to integrate with an existing codebase._

## Installation

Apply the gradle plugin.

```kotlin
plugins {
  id("dev.zacsweers.metro") version "x.y.z"
}
```

And that's it! The default configuration will add the multiplatform `runtime` artifact (which has annotations you can use) and wire it all automatically.

You can configure custom behaviors with APIs on the `metro` DSL extension.

```kotlin
metro {
  // Defines whether or not metro is enabled. Useful if you want to gate this behind a dynamic
  // build configuration.
  enabled = true // Default

  // Enable (extremely) verbose debug logging
  debug = false // Default
  
  // See the kdoc on MetroPluginExtension for full details
}
```

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository][snapshots].

## Supported platforms

The compiler plugin itself supports all multiplatform project types. The first-party annotations artifact is also multiplatform and supports all common JVM, JS, and native targets.

Contribution hint generation is _not_ currently supported on native or Wasm targets until [KT-58886](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-58886) is resolved. They do work within the same compilation though.

## Caveats

- Kotlin compiler plugins are not a stable API! Compiled outputs from this plugin _should_ be stable, but usage in newer versions of kotlinc are not guaranteed to be stable. That said, Metro will strive to make matching releases available quickly and test against Kotlin prereleases eagerly.
