### Graph extensions are no longer detached.

**TL;DR: Metro graph extensions are now wired similar to Dagger subcomponents and use a new `@GraphExtension` annotation. `@Extends` and `isExtendable` are now deleted, `@ContributesGraphExtension` and `enableScopedInjectClassHints()` are deprecated.**

Up to this point, Metro's graph extensions have been _detached_. This meant that extensions could simply depend on a parent graph via `@Extends` and parent graphs had to mark themselves as extendable via `isExtendable = true`. This approach mirrored kotlin-inject's approach and was convenient in its flexibility. However, it's proven too problematic in practice for a few reasons:

1. Parent graphs have to generate a bunch of extra code for extensions. Namely, scoped providers and any instances of containers/parents they are holding on to need accessors. It also generates extra metadata (metro serializes its own metadata to its types) for separate graphs to read.
2. Because of the above, parent graphs had to opt-in to extension via `isExtendable = true`.
3. Up to this point, parent graphs always held scoped providers for all `@Provides` bindings in it or containers, _even if they do not use them_.
4. Similar to #3, we've had to add support for automatic discovery of scoped constructor-injected classes (via `enableScopedInjectClassHints()`) to ensure they are also held at the appropriate scope.
5. This has ended up causing a lot of headaches because eager validation complicates these in scenarios where you have multiple graphs that may not actually use that class anywhere (and thus not provide some of its dependencies)
6. Because every graph must expose every available binding to unknown extensions, every graph in a chain is often bloated with bindings it doesn't use.

Metro _could_ optimize the `@ContributesGraphExtension` cases where Metro's compiler has a view of the entire graph chain, but that would frankly leave Metro with a lot of edge cases to deal with and users with needing to know about two different ways to extend graphs. We opted against that, and instead are now going to process graph extensions in a similar way to Dagger's **subcomponents**.

This will allow Metro to

1. Fully optimize the whole graph chain.
2. Automatically scope bindings in parents (no need to expose accessors for scoped bindings unused in parents).
3. Only generate _exactly_ the bindings that are used in each graph with lazy validation of bindings.

#### `@GraphExtension`

`@GraphExtension` is a new annotation to denote a graph that is an extension. This is analogous to Dagger's `@Subcomponent` and dagger interop treats it as such.

To connect an extension to a parent graph, you can do one of multiple ways:

- Declare an accessor on the parent graph directly.

```kotlin
@GraphExtension
interface LoggedInGraph

@DependencyGraph
interface AppGraph {
  val loggedInGraph: LoggedInGraph
}
```

- (If the extension has a creator) declare the creator on the parent graph directly.

```kotlin
@GraphExtension
interface LoggedInGraph {
  @GraphExtension.Factory
  interface Factory {
    fun createLoggedInGraph(): LoggedInGraph
  }
}

@DependencyGraph
interface AppGraph {
  val loggedInGraphFactory: LoggedInGraph.Factory
}
```

- (If the extension has a creator) make the parent graph implement the creator.

```kotlin
@GraphExtension
interface LoggedInGraph {
  @GraphExtension.Factory
  interface Factory {
    fun createLoggedInGraph(): LoggedInGraph
  }
}

@DependencyGraph
interface AppGraph : LoggedInGraph.Factory
```

- Contribute the factory to the parent graph via `@ContributesTo`.

```kotlin
@GraphExtension(LoggedInScope::class)
interface LoggedInGraph {
  @ContributesTo(AppScope::class)
  @GraphExtension.Factory
  interface Factory {
    fun createLoggedInGraph(): LoggedInGraph
  }
}

@DependencyGraph(AppScope::class)
interface AppGraph
```

#### Migration

The following APIs have been removed or deprecated:

- `@Extends`. Migrate to `@GraphExtension`, remove this parameter, and expose the factory in the parent graph API as documented above.
- `isExtendable` is removed from `@DependencyGraph` and `@ContributesGraphExtension`.
- `@ContributesGraphExtension` is now deprecated and treated like `@GraphExtension`.
- `@ContributesGraphExtension.Factory` is deprecated with **error** severity and requires migration to the new `@ContributesTo` pattern.
- `enableScopedInjectClassHints()` is now deprecated and does nothing. It will be removed in the future.
- Graph extensions may no longer have multiple direct parents.

To create graph extensions, you now _must_ do so via a parent graph (using one of the above connecting mechanisms).

### Other changes

- **Breaking change**: Rename `custom-graph` compiler option to `custom-dependency-graph`.
- **Breaking change**: Rename `custom-dependency-graph-factory` compiler option to `custom-dependency-graph-factory`.
- **Breaking change**: Rename `MetroPluginExtension.graph` gradle extension property to `MetroPluginExtension.dependencyGraph`.
- **Breaking change**: Rename `MetroPluginExtension.graphFactory` gradle extension property to `MetroPluginExtension.dependencyGraphFactory`.

- **Behavior change**: `chunkFieldInits()` is now enabled by default.
- **Behavior change**: When adding bindings from extended parent graphs, ignore any that are provided directly in the child graph. Previously, Metro only ignored the binding if the binding was itself a graph type.
- **New**: Add diagnostic reports for (valid) cycles. This means if you have a cycle in your graph and enable a `reportsDestination`, Metro will generate files with a list of all the keys in that cycle.
- **Enhancement**: In tracing logs, include the graph name in the "Transform dependency graph" sections.
- **Enhancement**: Allow contributing annotations on assisted-injected classes.

- **Enhancement**: Improve error message for invalid assisted inject bindings to injected target.
- **Enhancement**: Report similar bindings in missing binding errors where the similar binding doesn't have a qualifier but the requested binding does. Previously we only reported if the similar binding had a qualifier and the requested binding didn't.
- **Fix**: Don't link expect/actual declarations if they're in the same file.
- **Fix**: Don't copy map keys over into generated `@Binds` contributions unless it's an `@IntoMap` binding.
- **Fix**: Fall back to annotation sources if needed when reporting errors with bound types in FIR.
- **Fix**: Use `MapProviderFactory.builder().build()` for Dagger interop on `Map<Key, Provider<Value>>` types as there is no `MapProviderFactory.empty()`.
- **Fix**: Don't assume `@ContributesGraphExtension` to have aggregation scopes during graph generation.
- **Fix**: When extending graphs, ignore bindings of the same type as the inheriting graph.
- **Fix**: Propagate parent graph empty `@Multibinds` declarations to extensions.
- **Fix**: Propagate managed binding containers to extension graphs.
- **Fix**: Propagate transitively included binding containers contributed to contributed graphs (sorry, word soup).
- **Fix**: Make generated multibinding element IDs stable across compilations.
- **Fix**: Handle location-less declarations when reporting invalid assisted inject bindings.
- **Fix**: Don't chunk parent graph validation statements as these must be in the original constructor body.
- **Fix**: Fix wrong receiver context for chunked field initializers.
- **Fix**: Fix support for generic private injected constructors.
- [internal change] Simplify metadata and just use accessor annotations.
- [internal change] Graph extension impls are now generated as nested classes within the generated metro graph that they are contributed to.

0.5.3
-----

_2025-07-28_

- **Behavior change:** The `enableScopedInjectClassHints` option is no longer enabled by default. This option is tricky to get right and will be iterated on further in [#764](https://github.com/ZacSweers/metro/issues/764).
- **Enhancement:** Generate synthetic `$$BindsMirror` classes to...
    - support full IC compatibility with changing annotations and return types on `@Binds` and `@Multibinds` declarations
    - allow these declarations to be `private`
- **Enhancement:** Allow `@Binds` and `@Multibinds` functions to be private.
- **Enhancement:** Allow "static graphs" via companions implementing the graph interface itself.
- **Enhancement:** Allow graphs to aggregate `internal` contributions from other compilations IFF those compilations are marked as friend paths. This mainly allows for test graphs to consume contributions from their corresponding main source sets.
- **Enhancement:** Allow `internal` graphs to extend `internal` contributed interfaces from other compilations IFF those compilations are marked as friend paths.
- **Fix:** Sort soft edges before hard edges within (valid) cycles. Previously we would just apply a standard topological sort here, but in this scenario we want to add extra weight to ready-up nodes that depend directly on the deferred type being used to break the cycle first.
- **Fix:** When recording IC lookups of overridable declarations, only record the original declaration and not fake overrides.
- **Fix:** Record IC lookups to `@Multibinds` declarations.
- **Fix:** Write `@Multibinds` information to metro metadata.
- **Fix:** Always write metro metadata to `@BindingContainer` classes, even if empty.
- **Fix:** When `@Includes`-ing other graphs, link against the original interface accessor rather than the generated `$$MetroGraph` accessor.
- **Fix:** Disambiguate contributed nullable bindings from non-nullable bindings.
- **Fix:** When computing `@Includes` graph dependencies from accessors, only consider directly included graphs and not transitively included graphs.
- **Fix:** Expose `@Includes` graph dependencies as synthetic `_metroAccessor` types for extended graphs rather than exposing the included graph directly.
- **Fix:** Prohibit calling `.asContribution()` on `@ContributesGraphExtension`-annotated types. `@ContributesGraphExtension`-annotated types cannot be validated at compile-time with this function as their generated class is definitionally contextual and the compiler cannot infer that from callsites of this function alone.
- **Fix:** Only process `@DependencyGraph` types in FIR supertype generation. Contributed graph extension supertypes are merged only in IR.
- **Fix:** Generate `$$MetroContribution` binds functions before aggregating contributions.
- **Fix:** Don't short-circuit class visiting in contribution visiting in IR.
- **Fix:** Propagate property annotations for `@Provides`-properties, previously only the accessor function annotations were being included.
- **Fix:** Propagate class annotations for `@Inject`-annotated constructors to factory class mirror functions, previously only the constructor's annotations were being included.
- **Fix:** Fix dispatch receiver for `DelegateFactory` fields when `chunkFieldInits` is enabled.
- **Fix:** Fix compilation error for members-injected classes with no direct, but only inherited `@Inject` attributes.
- **Fix:** Always look up member injectors of ancestor classes of classes member-injected by graphs (sorry, word soup I know).
- **Fix:** Ensure `$$MetroContribution` interfaces are not generated for binding containers by ensuring binding container annotations are readable during their generation.
- Change to `UnsupportedOperationException` for compiler intrinsic stubs, matching what the stdlib does.
- Add a `ViewModel` assisted injection example to `compose-navigation-app` sample.
- Small improvements to the doc site (404 page, favicon, etc.)

0.5.1
-----

_2025-07-18_

- **Breaking change:** Rename the `generateHintProperties` Gradle DSL property to `generateContributionHints`.
- **Enhancement:** Chunk field initializers and constructor statements across multiple init functions to avoid `MethodTooLargeException` in large graphs. This is currently experimental and gated behind the `chunkFieldInits()` Gradle DSL.
- **Enhancement:** Mark generated factories and member injectors' constructors as `private`, matching the same [change in Dagger 2.57](https://github.com/google/dagger/releases/tag/dagger-2.57).
- **Enhancement:** Add a new Metro option `warnOnInjectAnnotationPlacement` to disable suggestion to lift @Inject to class when there is only one constructor, the warning applies to constructors with params too.
- **Fix:** Fix `@Contributes*.replaces` not working if the contributed type is in the same compilation but a different file.
- **Fix:** Fix generated `MembersInjector.create()` return types' generic argument to use the target class.
- **Fix:** Don't generated nested MetroContribution classes for binding containers.
- **Fix:** Fix contributing binding containers across compilations.

0.3.0
-----

_2025-05-05_

- **New**: Add support for `@ContributesGraphExtension`! See the [docs](https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/dependency-graphs#contributed-graph-extensions) for more info.
- **New**: Add a `asContribution()` compiler intrinsic to upcast graphs to expected contribution types. For example: `val contributedInterface = appGraph.asContribution<ContributedInterface>()`. This is validated at compile-time.
- **New**: Automatically transform `@Provides` functions to be `private`. This is enabled by defaults and supersedes the `publicProviderSeverity` when enabled, and can be disabled via the Gradle extension or `transform-providers-to-private` compiler option. Note that properties and providers with any annotations with `KClass` arguments are not supported yet pending upstream kotlinc changes.
- **Enhancement**: Rewrite the internal `BindingGraph` implementation to be more performant, accurate, and testable.
- **Enhancement**: Add diagnostic to check that graph factories don't provide their target graphs as parameters.
- **Enhancement**: Add diagnostic to check that a primary scope is defined if any additionalScopes are also defined on a graph annotation.
- **Enhancement**: Add diagnostic to validate that contributed types do not have narrower visibility that aggregating graphs. i.e. detect if you accidentally try to contribute an `internal` type to a `public` graph.
- **Enhancement**: Optimize supertype lookups when building binding classes by avoiding previously visited classes.
- **Enhancement**: Don't generate hints for contributed types with non-public API visibility.
- **Enhancement**: When reporting duplicate binding errors where one of the bindings is contributed, report the contributing class in the error message.
- **Enhancement**: When reporting scope incompatibility, check any extended parents match the scope and suggest a workaround in the error diagnostic.
- **Enhancement**: Allow AssistedFactory methods to be protected.
- **Fix**: Fix incremental compilation when a parent graph or supertype modifies/removes a provider.
- **Fix**: Fix rank processing error when the outranked binding is contributed using Metro's ContributesBinding annotation.

- **Fix**: Fix qualifiers getting ignored on accessors from `@Includes` dependencies.
- **Fix**: Fix transitive scoped dependencies not always getting initialized first in graph provider fields.
- **Fix**: Fix injected `lateinit var` properties being treated as if they have default values.
- **Fix**: Alias bindings not always having their backing type visited during graph validation.
- **Fix**: Fix race condition in generating parent graphs first even if child graph is encountered first in processing.
- **Fix**: Fallback `AssistedInjectChecker` error report to the declaration source.
- **Fix**: Fix missing parent supertype bindings in graph extensions.
- **Change**: `InstanceFactory` is no longer a value class. This wasn't going to offer much value in practice.
- **Change**: Change debug reports dir to be per-compilation rather than per-platform.

0.2.0
-----

_2025-04-21_

- **New**: Nullable bindings are now allowed! See the [nullability docs](https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/bindings#nullability) for more info.
- **Enhancement**: Add diagnostics for multibindings with star projections.
- **Enhancement**: Add diagnostic for map multibindings with nullable keys.
- **Fix**: Ensure assisted factories' target bindings' parameters are processed in MetroGraph creation. Previously, these weren't processed and could result in scoped bindings not being cached.
- **Fix**: Fix duplicate field accessors generated for graph supertypes.
- Add [compose navigation sample](https://github.com/ZacSweers/metro/tree/main/samples/compose-navigation-app).

0.1.3
-----

_2025-04-18_

- **Change**: Multibindings may not be empty by default. To allow an empty multibinding, `@Multibinds(allowEmpty = true)` must be explicitly declared now.
- **New**: Write graph metadata to reports (if enabled).
- **New**: Support configuring debug and reports globally via `metro.debug` and `metro.reportsDestination` Gradle properties (respectively).
- **Enhancement**: Change how aggregation hints are generated to improve incremental compilation. Externally contributed hints are now looked up lazily per-scope instead of all at once.
- **Enhancement**: Optimize empty map multibindings to reuse a singleton instance.
- **Enhancement**: Report error diagnostic if Dagger's `@Reusable` is used on a provider or injected class.
- **Enhancement**: Tweak diagnostic error strings for members so that IDE terminals auto-link them better. i.e., instead of printing `example.AppGraph.provideString`, Metro will print `example.AppGraph#provideString` instead.
- **Enhancement**: Support repeatable @ContributesBinding annotations with different scopes.
- **Fix**: Fix incremental compilation when `@Includes`-annotated graph parameters change accessor signatures.
- **Fix**: Don't allow graph extensions to use the same scope as any extended ancestor graphs.
- **Fix**: Don't allow multiple ancestor graphs of graph extensions to use the same scope.
- **Fix**: Handle scenarios where the compose-compiler plugin runs _before_ Metro's when generating wrapper classes for top-level `@Composable` functions.
- **Fix**: Fix an edge case in graph extensions where child graphs would miss a provided scoped binding in a parent graph that was also exposed as an accessor.
- **Fix**: Fix Dagger interop issue when calling Javax/Jakarta/Dagger providers from Metro factories.
- **Fix**: Fix Dagger interop issue when calling `dagger.Lazy` from Metro factories.
- **Fix**: Preserve the original `Provider` or `Lazy` type used in injected types when generating factory creators.
- Temporarily disable hint generation in WASM targets to avoid file count mismatches until [KT-75865](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-75865).
- Add an Android sample: https://github.com/ZacSweers/metro/tree/main/samples/android-app
- Add a multiplatform Circuit sample: https://github.com/ZacSweers/metro/tree/main/samples/circuit-app
- Add samples docs: https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/samples
- Add FAQ docs: https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/faq

0.1.2
-----

_2025-04-08_

- **Enhancement**: Implement `createGraph` and `createGraphFactory` FIR checkers for better error diagnostics on erroneous type arguments.
- **Enhancement**: Add `ContributesBinding.rank` interop support with Anvil.
- **Enhancement**: Check Kotlin version compatibility. Use the `metro.version.check=false` Gradle property to disable these warnings if you're feeling adventurous.
- **Fix**: Fix class-private qualifiers on multibinding contributions in other modules not being recognized in downstream graphs.
- **Fix**: Fix member injectors not getting properly visited in graph validation.
- **Fix**: Fix a bug where `Map<Key, Provider<Value>>` multibindings weren't always unwrapped correctly.
- **Fix**: Fix `Map<Key, Provider<Value>>` type keys not correctly interpreting the underlying type key as `Map<Key, Value>`.
- **Change**: Change `InstanceFactory` to a value class.
- **Change**: Make `providerOf` use `InstanceFactory` under the hood.
