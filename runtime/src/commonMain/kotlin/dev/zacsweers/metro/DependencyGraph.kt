/**
 * Declares the annotated type to be a dependency graph. Metro's compiler plugin will build,
 * validate, and implement this graph at compile-time.
 *
 * Graph types must be either an interface or an abstract class.
 *
 * ## Scoping
 *
 * _See [Scope] before reading this section!_
 *
 * Graphs may declare a [scope] (and optionally [additionalScopes] if there are more). Each of these
 * declared scopes act as an implicit [SingleIn] representation of that scope. For example:
 * ```
 * @DependencyGraph(AppScope::class)
 * interface AppGraph
 * ```
 *
 * Is functionally equivalent to writing the below.
 *
 * ```
 * @SingleIn(AppScope::class)
 * @DependencyGraph(AppScope::class)
 * interface AppGraph
 * ```
 *
 * ## Creating a graph
 *
 * For simple graphs with no creator types, an implicit one will be generated. You can instantiate
 * them with [createGraph].
 *
 * ```
 * val graph = createGraph<AppGraph>()
 * ```
 *
 * For creators (more below), you can create a factory with [createGraphFactory].
 *
 * ```
 * val graph = createGraphFactory<AppGraph.Factory().create("hello!")
 * ```
 *
 * ## Providers
 *
 * Graph types can declare providers via [Provides] and [Binds] to provide dependencies into the
 * graph.
 *
 * Graph _creators_ can provide instance dependencies and other graphs as dependencies.
 *
 * ```
 * @DependencyGraph
 * interface AppGraph {
 *   val httpClient: HttpClient
 *
 *   @Provides fun provideHttpClient: HttpClient = HttpClient()
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Creators
 *
 * Graphs can have _creators_. Right now, this just means [Factory] creators. See its doc for more
 * details.
 *
 * ## Aggregation
 *
 * Graphs can automatically _aggregate_ contributed bindings and interfaces. Any contributions to
 * the same scope will be automatically aggregated to this graph. This includes contributions
 * generated from [ContributesTo] (supertypes), [ContributesBinding], [ContributesIntoSet], and
 * [ContributesIntoMap].
 *
 * ```
 * @DependencyGraph(AppScope::class)
 * interface AppGraph
 *
 * @ContributesTo(AppScope::class)
 * interface HttpClientProvider {
 *   val httpClient: HttpClient
 * }
 *
 * @ContributesBinding(AppScope::class)
 * @Inject
 * class RealHttpClient(...) : HttpClient
 *
 * // Results in generated code like...
 * @DependencyGraph(AppScope::class)
 * interface AppGraph : HttpClientProvider {
 *   /* fake */ override val RealHttpClient.bind: HttpClient
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @property scope The scope this graph extension aggregates.
 * @property additionalScopes Additional scopes this graph extension aggregates. [scope] must be
 *   defined if this is defined, as this property is purely for convenience.
 * @property excludes Optional list of excluded contributing classes (requires a [scope] to be
 *   defined).
 * @property bindingContainers Optional list of included binding containers. See the doc on
 *   [BindingContainer] for more details.

@Target(AnnotationTarget.CLASS)
public annotation class DependencyGraph(
  val scope: KClass<*> = Nothing::class,
  val additionalScopes: Array<KClass<*>> = [],

  /**
   * Graph factories can be declared as a single nested declaration within the target graph to
   * create instances with bound instances (via [Provides]) or graph dependencies (via [Includes]).
   *
   * ```
   * @DependencyGraph
   * interface AppGraph {
   *   @DependencyGraph.Factory
   *   fun interface Factory {
   *     fun create(@Provides text: String, networkGraph: NetworkGraph)
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * In the above example, the `text` parameter is an _instance_ binding (analogous to
   * `@BindsInstance` in Dagger) and available as a binding on the graph.
   *
   * The `networkGraph` parameter is a _graph_ dependency. This can be any type and is treated as
   * another [DependencyGraph] type. Any type these deps expose as _accessors_ are available as
   * bindings to this graph. For example:
   * ```
   * interface NetworkGraph {
   *   val httpClient: HttpClient
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * In this case, `HttpClient` would be an available binding in the consuming `AppGraph`. Only
   * explicitly declared accessors are considered candidates for bindings.
   *
   * ## Graph factory generation
   *
   * Metro will automatically generate one of the following scenarios for graph factories:
   * ```
   *                      ┌────────────────────┐
   *                ┌─────┤Has a graph factory?├──┐

   * ```
   *
   * All of this happens under the hood and [createGraph]/[createGraphFactory] with resolve the
   * correct one to use.
   *
   * ## Using generated declarations directly
   *
   * If you
   * [enable third party FIR plugins in the IDE](https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/installation/#ide-support),
   * these will be visible and directly linkable. However, your mileage may vary and it's
   * recommended to stick with the graph creator intrinsics for now until the IDE support is
   * improved.
